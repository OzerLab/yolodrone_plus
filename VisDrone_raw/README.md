This repository was designed to solve object tracking problem. The first step to solve the object tracking problem is object detection. Therefore, we used VisDrone-MOT Dataset and convert the image and annonation directories to object detection format. To sum up the util.py code is capable of converting the MOT directory format to OD format as well as converting the VisDrone annotation format, same format as coco, to work within YOLO format.

For more explanation please refer to:

## Downloading Dataset:
Please download Task 4: Multi-Object Tracking dataset from the following official VisDrone GitHub [link](https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset#task-4-multi-object-tracking).
